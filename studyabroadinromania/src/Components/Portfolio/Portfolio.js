        <h1>My Journey: Hungary & Romania</h1>
        
        <div className="description-box">
          <p>
            I am a first-generation Chinese adoptee, and I have not traveled much since being adopted. 
            I have traveled mostly within the United States, with the one exception of traveling to Cuba 
            for my sister's wedding. This trip to Hungary and Romania represents a significant milestone 
            as my first true international journey. I have established definite objectives involving 
            volunteer work, exploration, and practical learning activities.
          </p>

          <p>
            My preparations have helped me reach a state of readiness and concentration. The knowledge 
            I seek in Hungary and Romania will help me achieve a deeper understanding of the world 
            beyond media portrayals. Direct experience will enable me to study the culture, 
            religion, and historical background of the area firsthand.
          </p>

          <p>
            My trip to Cuba provided valuable insights into how people from different backgrounds 
            experience life and maintain happiness. I witnessed how daily gestures and basic items 
            carry great value. I hope to experience that same level of humility and awareness 
            during my upcoming travels.
          </p>

          <p>
            A primary objective is the development of communication skills. Navigating countries 
            where English is not the primary language will require me to develop new methods of 
            connecting. I aim to improve my listening and body language skills, ensuring I can 
            communicate respectfully even when language creates obstacles.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, I want to obtain untainted information about global developments to 
            support my professional advancement. Direct observation of these cultural practices 
            will help me understand new perspectives and develop greater patience.
